# Algorithms-and-Data-Structures
Implementations of various algorithms and data structures in Java, for personal and educational use. All implementations have accompanying tests and are working as expected.

## Currently implemented:
Algorithms:
* Graph:
  * Single Source Shortest Paths (Dijkstra)
  * Topological Ordering (Kahn)
* Search:
  * Binary Search
* Sorting:
  * Heap Sort
  * Shell Sort
  * Quicksort
  * Bubble Sort
  * Insertion Sort
  * Radix Sort (MSD)

Data Structures:
* Graph (supports weights and directed edges)
* Priority Queue
* Linked List
* Array List
* Binary Search Tree
